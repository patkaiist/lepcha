# lepcha-tricl
A macOS keyboard layout for Lepcha script based on key assignments of the Shipmoo font released by Ren Ugen Shipmoo in 2001. This layout was created for the _Training and Resources for Indigenous Community Linguists_ workshop (TRICL) under the Centre for Cultural-Linguistic Diversity, Eastern Himalaya (CCLD-EH) http://ccld-eh.org.

This keyboard layout was created to enable in-language transcription on macOS along with the built-in onscreen keyboard. Key assignments are based on placement in the Shipmoo non-Unicode font as familiar placements among Lepcha speakers. The layout is also intended to avoid compatibility issues around using Keyman with software such as ELAN.

Created by Kellen Parker van Dam with Reep Pandi Lepcha at TRICL6, January 2025.
